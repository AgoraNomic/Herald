My friends and colleagues, now that we are before the court, the honorable
G. presiding, I think we should maintain some decorum. I propose the
following rule, to maintain order in the court: all rules and
pronouncements we see, in the form of arguments shall be.

THE JUDGE RULES
Please all be seated.  The Court recognizes Counsellor Aris's Rule as
having VALID standing.  While the Court approves of the decorum imposed by
this rule and raises an eyebrow of amusement at the rhyming couplet, the
Court also imposes a tenth of a point penalty to remind Counsellor Aris of
the importance of clear grammar before this court.  
Style +0.9.


#2 V.J. Rada 6 Jul 2018 09:54:51 +1000
I humbly submit this rule and argument to the Court: With respect, for
multiple reasons, this court should rule that Agora is the best game of all
time, and future rules should address this proposition.

THE JUDGE RULES
Counsellor V.J. Rada's standing and rule are recognized as VALID.  Further,
Counsellor V.J. Rada's phrasing at the question before the Court marks em 
as an advocate for Agora, consistency of position will be expected as a
future style determinant.  
Style +1.0.


#3 Aris 5 Jul 2018 23:46:01 -0700
I humbly submit that while future arguments should address the stated
proposition, they may do so by attempting to either refute or support it.
After all, the court can't really do its job without arguments on both 
sides of the issue. There is a reasonable argument that since FRC is an
older game, originating during the existence Nomic World itself, it has a
better claim to greatness.

THE JUDGE RULES
The Court finds this VALID and marks Counsellor Aris as an opposing 
Council to Agora.  
Style +1.0.


#4 Publius Scribonius Scholasticus 6 Jul 2018 10:57:31 -0400
I hereby submit this rule and argument to the Court, on the PROCEDURAL
docket: Recommendations in arguments for the court to rule in a
certain manner are not binding to the court. For the good of the game,
the court ought to recognize "should" as creating a recommendation not
a binding obligation. Finally, the court is reminded that multiple
dockets may be open at once and arguments SHALL be sorted by docket by
the submitter or as being PROCEDURAL. Arguments need only be
consistent with other arguments of eir docket and those arguments
deemed PROCEDURAL, so as to ensure that multiple issues are addressed
simultaneously, The court is asked to recognize FRC-1 as PROCEDURAL.
The court is asked to recognize the later arguments of V.J. Rada and
Aris as being on Docket #1. The Honorable Judge G. CAN and MAY
reclassify rules across dockets, if its original placement was with
arguments on a different issue. Arguments may be placed on multiple
dockets, if they pertain to multiple issues. If a new issue arises on
a docket, all arguments pertaining to that issue SHOULD be put on a
new docket, while remaining on the previous docket.

THE JUDGE RULES.
Counsellor Publius Scribonius Scholasticus presents a VALID argument to
the Court.  This Court notes that the VALIDITY against previous rules only
comes from defining SHOULD as used in previous arguments, such that e 
avoids addressing the actual proposition, which strikes the Court as
Being Sneaky.  While the Court recognizes the that this passes logical
muster, a loss of style is recorded.  The Court notes the distinction
between PROCEDURAL and other Dockets going forward and appreciates the
procedural distinction; however, to limit digressions, Consellors are
recommended (for now) to keep their arguments in either PROCEDURAL or
Docket #1 to avoid style losses.  Finally, the Counsellor's rule seeks to
bind the Court (with reclassification rules) which oversteps the bounds of
eir position - watch it, Counsellor.
STYLE:  1.0 (base) - 0.5 (Should redefinition) + 1.0 (Docket concept) 
       -1.0 (binding the judge) = 0.5
       
The Court notes that Rules #1 and #4 are PROCEDURAL, and #2 and #3 are
on Docket 1.
