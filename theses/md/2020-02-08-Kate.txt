I think your goal is laudable; and since all the proposals I've
submitted would, in fact, all improve the game (in my opinion) if
adopted, I do want on some level to give you the assurance you desire.
But I feel quite strongly on principle that warranties against scams and
loopholes should not be given on a blanket basis. I will set out why I
believe this, in the hope of persuading you to agree.

Although I understand and respect your personal dislike of scams and
loopholes, I don't think it's possible to deny that they are an
important and enjoyable part of the game for many people. As a general
rule, Agoran society does not shun or ostracise perpetrators of scams,
provided that they act responsibly and non-destructively; in fact, it
honours them, with the patent title Scamster, which has been awarded
several times in the past and indeed is currently singled out
specifically as an "award" in Rule 2581.

Recent scam attempts, successful or otherwise, have also all been
treated more with interest than with antipathy, especially if they are
novel or witty. Today (19th January), for example, Falsifian presented
an attempt to declare apathy - a traditional target of scams. Nobody
expressed eir disapproval, and indeed when e discovered that e had made
a trivial mistake in eir attempt, and withdrew eir CFJ into the matter,
another player resubmitted the CFJ, correcting the mistake and calling
it "interesting". That player, as you may remember, was you.

Another recent example I would like to discuss is the case of Proposal
8285, authored by Alexis, which contained a potential escalator scam
(that might or might not have been intentional) pointed out by Jason
Cobb. As I mentioned during its voting period, I strongly suspected that
it contained a scam, but nevertheless initially voted FOR it because I
couldn't find the scam upon examination. I believed that Alexis's skill
at hiding eir scam, if it existed, was a sufficient achievement that e
deserved its inclusion in the ruleset; and, based on eir behaviour
during eir past successful scams, which turn up impressively frequently
when browsing the mailing list archives, I trusted (and still trust)
em not to unnecessarily wreak havoc on Agora if and when e is successful
at perpetrating one.

I don't think that my thought process here will be unusual or
unrelatable to many Agorans (although I would be fascinated to find
differently). Agora is built around textual literalism. Why should we
stigmatise cleverly worded texts if they are used responsibly?

"Responsibility" is perhaps a poorly descriptive term in the context of
the perpetration of a scam, so let me explain what I mean. There are
some parts of the game that I feel should not be considered socially
acceptable targets of scams, for what I hope are obvious reasons. These
include the historical records of ribbons, wins and patent titles, as
well as the general health of Agora. This last is something rather
harder to define, but I think you and most other players will understand
broadly what I mean by it; I would consider something like the Annabel
Crisis or last year's dependent action panic to be "unhealthy", although
of course the latter was not an intentional scam from anybody.

If you wish, I will warrant that, to the best of my knowledge, none of
the proposals harm any of those things. I would not intentionally seek
to harm them anyway, regardless of any pledge, warranty or other
obligation, or absence thereof.

What I will not do, barring sufficiently persuasive arguments to the
contrary, is make a blanket statement that I am not planning or engaging
in any scams or exploits. I don't want to end up in a situation where I
am (or _anybody_ is) totally unable to take part in this part of the
game, just because it is considered suspicious to not currently be under
a pledge/warranty forbidding it, and I'm concerned that complying now
with your request would lead Agora towards a social climate of that
type.

I acknowledge that my refusal may well cause you and others to be
suspicious of my proposals in this distribution, and possibly even to
vote against them when you would not otherwise have done so.
Nonetheless, I feel that the benefits they would bring if adopted are
less important than the principle I have outlined above.

I'm not trying to proselytise here - as I noted above, your stance of
opposition to deviousness is well-recorded and well-regarded, at least
by me - but I hope that you will consider my words equitably and rethink
your stated intention to vote against my proposals.

Unless, of course, you do somehow detect a loophole in one of them.

Thank you.
