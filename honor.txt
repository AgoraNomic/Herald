       Notice of Honour that player has published in the current week;
      
    2. Specify any other active player or Agora to gain karma, and
       provide a reason for specifying that player; and
      
    3. Specify any active player or Agora to lose karma, and provide a
       reason for specifying that player.
      
    4. Not result in Agora's karma moving farther away from 0.
