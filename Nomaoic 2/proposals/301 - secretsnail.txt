Amend Rule 202 to read, in full:

One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one
rule-change, and (2) by the Herald calculating a random number from one
to ten and adding that number of points to the player's score. A player
takes a turn by privately communicating their intention to do so, along
with the proposed rule-change and a name for the proposal, to the Herald. When a player takes a
turn, the Herald shall announce player taking the turn and the number of
points gained by the player. The Herald shall also announce the number
of the proposed rule-change, the name for the proposal, and a cryptographic hash of its contents,
but shall list proposed rule-changes separately and in a different order
from any other information e publishes in the course of a player's turn,
such that it is not clear which players proposed which rule-changes.
