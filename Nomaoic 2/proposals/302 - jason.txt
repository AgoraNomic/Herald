Rule 202 is amended to:

{

2XX. One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) optionally, proposing one
rule-change, and (2) by the Herald calculating a random number from one
to ten and adding that number of points to the player's score. A player
takes a turn by privately communicating their intention to do so, along
with any required values, to the Herald. When a player takes a
turn, the Herald shall announce player taking the turn and the number of
points gained by the player. The Herald shall also announce the number
of the proposed rule-change and a cryptographic hash of its contents if a rule-change was submitted,
but shall list proposed rule-changes separately and in a different order
from any other information e publishes in the course of a player's turn,
such that it is not clear which players proposed which rule-changes.

When a player takes a turn without submitting a proposed rule-change, e gains 3 additional points.
