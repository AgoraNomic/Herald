RS1: Ruleset of 11/3/98.
Date	Event	Source	Notes
6/30/93	Agora begins	Ruleset 11/3/98 (RS1).
[Charter Members: Doug Chatham, Joe Lindsay, Blob, Eric Scheirer, Dave Bowen, David Nicol, Michael Norrish.]
7/1/93 0:00 GMT	Prop. 301	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Doug Chatham, failed 2-3.
2:45 GMT	Prop. 302	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Joe Lindsay, passed 4-2. Proposals earn points equal to F-A votes.
Prop. 303	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Joe Lindsay, passed 5-1 Limited number of Proposals by one Player.
10:30 GMT	Prop. 304	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Blob, failed 2-4. Would have introduced Extra Votes.
[Note that dates as given are obviously the dates each proposal was made. Later, as will be noted below, this seems to switch to the date of the end of the Voting Period, but there are discrepancies.]
[Joined: Wes, delphin, Ronald Kunne, Karl Anderson, Deb & Bob, Richard Vickery. Left: Blob, Doug Chatham. Note that the only way to know who was a player at a given point is by who voted or Judged CFJs. As far as I know this is the only record. Therefore, the players above could have joined any time during the Voting Period of Props 301-3 (i.e., July 1-8), and the date a Player leaves can only be approximated. Also note I was not 100% diligent in listing Players joining or (especially) leaving, so the list is probably incomplete.]

(Friday the 13th!)
8/16/93	CFJ 9	CFJ Logs	Submitted by D. Cogen. Statement: Votes submitted before the current Speaker took office are valid. Judgment: FALSE.
CFJ 10	CFJ Logs, RS1, stare.txt	Submitted? by Deb & Bob Proposal sent by the Old Speaker to New Speaker remains valid. Judgment: TRUE.
[Hitherto I have been assuming that the individuals I have in my notes under each CFJ are the submitters. This is explicitly noted by me for CFJ 8, and explains why I have Jim Shea listed under CFJ 1 and Andre's stare decisis compilation lists Michael: One submitted, the other judged. In this case, however, we both have Deb and Bob, who must either be the submitter or the Judge, so one of the above assumptions is, at least in this case, false. Nevertheless, unless I have specific info otherwise, I will continue listing the submitter.]
Prop. 374	Prop. Logs	Proposed by J. Shea, passed 7-3. Regulated Point Transfers.
CFJ 11	CFJ Logs	Submitted by R. Vickery. Statement: Votes on a Proposal remain the same after a game ends. Judgment: TRUE.
[The contents of CFJs 10-12 clearly suggest a game had just ended. Since the questions are pretty basic, it stands to reason (also given the date) that the end of the first Game of Agora occurred shortly before Aug. 16. New info from Michael Norrish reveals that the winner was Wes, that he won when Oerjan agreed to trade Wes 58 points in exchange for voting FOR Proposal 361, giving Wes 109 points, over the 100 point win threshhold. Thus the game ended some time after August 8. Since Michael indicated that Props 360-372 were still up for vote, we can further refine the date to between August 11 (when Props 371-2 were submitted, according to the reasoning stated above), and August 16.]

[My notes say this was judged FALSE, Andre's stare decisis compilation TRUE. I think my notes are in error.

20:08:15	Prop. 527	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson, withdrawn.
Same time	Prop. 528	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson, withdrawn. Corrected by Prop. 530.
[I assume from the specific times that the last two proposals do belong to Sept. 20, presumably distribution as they were never voted on.]
13:15:58MET	CFJ 36	CFJ Logs	Accused speaker of Electioneering. Judged TRUE by K. Dankmeyer.
9/22/93 (18:44:38 PDT)	CFJ 37	CFJ Logs?	Subject unknown. Judged by K. Dankmeyer
CFJ 38	CFJ Logs?	Related to CotC crisis. No other info.
CFJ 39	CFJ Logs	Claimed Rule 406 conflicted with 106. Judged FALSE by Chuck.
CFJ 40	CFJ Logs	Claimed Prop. 499 does not require Speaker's Consent. Judged TRUE by Jeffrey S.
[This one is a bit strange, since 499 failed some time earlier. If I recall correctly, the Speaker could affect the number of votes required to pass a rule by giving or witholding Consent, but I can't see how that would apply.]
9/23/93	Prop. 529	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson, passed 5-4.
Prop. 530	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson, outcome unknown.
[both dated to 23:09:08, thus probably stemming ultimately from a distribution post.]
13:51:37	CFJ 41	CFJ Logs	Judged FALSE (?) by Jeffrey S. Subject unknown.
9/24/93 1:01:56	Prop. 535	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson, withdrawn.
[The above event is very important, as Proposal 533 is recorded five days later. This is further proof of the deducible fact that hitherto all dates are the dates of distribution, and all subsequent dates are dates the proposal passed (note almost no non-passing proposals get recorded from this point).]
20:13:10	CFJ 42	CFJ Logs	Claimed the Rules would take precedence over 537. Judged FALSE by Chuck.
[This is an interesting CFJ. Pity no record of 537 is preserved, probably because it never passed.]
20:16:32	CFJ 43	CFJ Logs	Judged TRUE by D. Cogen
20:18:34	CFJ 44	CFJ Logs	Argued the Speaker can delegate selection of Judges. Judged FALSE by Vlad.
[Since I doubt KoJen and I coordinated our judging, this implies the times given are times the CFJ was posted.]
20:35:47	CFJ 45	CFJ Logs	Claimed Rule 367 is/does not exist. Judged TRUE by Vlad.
Appeal of CFJ 36	CFJ Logs	Judgment of TRUE appealed
9/29/93	Appeal of CFJ 36	CFJ Logs	Judgment of CFJ 36 SUSTAINED
13:28:42	Prop. 533	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes,
Agora Dig.	passed 6-2. Rule governing trades, overseen by Banker.
9/30/93 13:28:42	Prop. 538	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck, passed 6-1.
16:51:08	Prop. 539	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Dankmeyer, withdrawn.
[I realize this weakens my argument given above, but I have no other explanation why Prop. 535 would be listed out of sequence nor why so many proposals would be missing. Likely withdrawn proposals were kept initially along with passed proposals, for unknown reasons.]
10/1/93	CFJ 46	CFJ Logs	Claimed Rule 445 did not require Speaker's Consent. Judged TRUE by Michael Oct 3.
CFJ 47	CFJ Logs	Claimed 470 was ambiguous. Judged TRUE by Vlad.
[I have this question marked in my notes, I believe because I didn't remember judging in this way. I suspected either the question or the judgment were incorrectly recorded. Without a copy of 470, I can't decide.)
10/4/93	CFJ 48	CFJ Logs	Judged by L. Smithmeier.

[Looks like the remains of a Scam, whether Greater or Lesser, but I myself can't remember any details.]
10/5/93	Prop. 534	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed 5-2
[That is the number in my notes. If it is not in error, again some screwy things are going on here. My only conclusion is that the Voting period on 534 was extended, or disputed by some CFJ, so that the results were announced late. I know that at one time the Voting Period was 14 days (although clearly not early on), so that may be the explanation.]
16:50:10	Prop. 542	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson, passed 4-3
16:50:47	Prop. 543	Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson, passed 4-3. Regulated the Grand Viziers. Amended 390?

Prop. 572	Prop. Logs	Author unknown. Withdrawn.
Prop. 574	Prop. Logs	Proposed by R. Kunne, passed 5-3. Title: Vototron II.
[Was the earlier Vototron repealed?]
Prop. 578	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck, passed 8-1
Prop. 582	Prop. Logs	Proposed by R. Kunne, passed 11-1
[Note increase in the number of votes between the first and the fourteenth of the month.]
10/14/93	Prop. 588	Prop. Logs	Proposed by KoJen, passed 11-1. Made KoJen Banker.
Prop. 591	Prop. Logs	Proposed by KoJen,
stare.txt	failed? 5-5.
[Andre's stare decisis compilation has a comment under this Rule. Did it pass, or didn't it? The CFJ is number 794, which suggests that it was submitted late in 1994, so it can't have regarded a dispute on the passage of 591. Perhaps 591 was determined to have passed at a later date.]
[I have noted that at or before this time Duane Watts and Matthew Sean Pardo joined, no doubt because their names started showing up in the voting records.]
Prop. 592	Prop. Logs	Proposed by J. Shea, passed 7-3.
Prop. 594	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes,
stare.txt	passed 6-4. Somehow related to Inf(ormal?) titles for Rules, and Declarations as I have in my notes, but the decisions in stare.txt have to do with legal Rule Changes.
Prop. 597	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed 10-3
Agora Dig.	Proposals have to have Titles.
Prop. 598	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed 10-3
Prop. 599	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed 9-4

Prop. 605	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed 7-3
Prop. 608	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed 8-5
[Many, if not all, of these proposals had to do with the creation of a Criminal Court, to enforce the legislation on Crimes already existing from Rule 391. As I recall, a few of the proposals in the program didn't pass, which contributed to the failure of the system.]
10/15/93	Prop. 609	Prop. Logs	Proposed by R. Kunne, passed 7-6. Regulated Point Reserve. Amended Rule 448?
10/18/93	Prop. 610	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck, passed 10-1 (Currencies I)

stare.txt	passed 10-4. Created Patent Titles.

Prop. 657	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed 10-4.
Prop. 658	RS1	Passed. Amended Rule 396.
[This is dated 10/29/93 in RS1. Interesting it didn't make the Proposal Logs, if it passed. Suggests proposal Logs may be incomplete even regarding only passed Proposals.]
Prop. 659	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes,
Agora Dig.	passed 10-4. Gave points for short Props., penalized long ones.
10/25/93	Prop. 662	Prop. Logs	Proposed by J. Shea. passed 12-2. Title "Liberalize CFJs"

Prop. 686	Prop. Logs	Proposed by R. Kunne, passed 7-0-6. Created the Groupmeister.
Prop. 686.1	Prop. Logs	Proposed by R. Kunne, passed 7-0-2. Had something to do with Peter Suber.
[Either the Speaker was having fun with a loophole, or Proposal 685 never existed and an additional number snuck in to make the total come out right.]
Prop. 688	Prop. Logs	Proposed by R. Kunne, passed 5-0-5
Prop. 690	Prop. Logs	Proposed by R. Kunne, passed 7-0-6 Allowed Judgment by majority.
Prop. 692	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Duane, passed 8-0-5.

Prop. 718	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck, passed 5-0-1.

Prop. 719	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck, passed 3-0-3.
Prop. 721	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck, passed 4-0-2.
[Note the great jump in votes cast between these proposals and those following. I have recorded that Gustaff Zibrowski joined about this time, but that can't explain all of it. It may be that Rule 519 was changed, or used for the first time, and that many of the Votes were bought.]
11/16/93	Prop. 724	Prop. Logs	Proposed by D. Wagner, passed 13-1-6.

11/17/93	Prop. 736	Prop. Logs	Proposed by KoJen, passed 8-1-4. Created PT of Marxist, to be given to the Player with the most Marks.

Prop. 761	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck, passed 17-0-0.
RS1	Amended Rule 658.
[Dated to 12/8/93 in RS1, strongly suggesting that the dates above are dates of distribution, not final vote tallying, which clashes with an earlier note. I am not sure how to resolve this.]
Prop. 754	RS1	Passed. Amended Rule 435.

Prop. 792	Prop. Logs	Proposed by Kojen, passed 5-1-1.
Events between Proposal 783 and Proposal 984 (Dated Aug 5, 1994) are very sketchy, and need elucidation. I have scraped together the following info from the last Proposal logs, Ruleset annotations, my own memory, and old e-mail (now lost).
12/21/93	Prop. 783 passed	Ruleset
[I recieved a Ruleset about that date with Prop. 783 included (according to my notes).]
[Note that this date is obviously the date (approximately) that 783 passed.]

If it had been decided that BRs passed, it would have had no in-game effect, of course, but might have spurred a meta-game resolution.]
